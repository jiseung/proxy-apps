    "longdesc" : "VPFFT is an implementation of a mesoscale micromechanical materials model. By solving the viscoplasticity model, VPFFT simulates the evolution of a material under deformation. The solution time to the viscoplasticity model, described by a set of partial differential equations, is significantly reduced by the application of Fast Fourier Transform in the VPFFT algorithm. The proxy application, VPFFT++, is a reference implementation of the algorithms in VPFFT. While capturing most of its computational complexity, VPFFT++ forgoes most of the machine specific optimizations and additional physics feature sets from the original VPFFT code. An algorithmic specification accompanying VPFFT++, detailing the implemented algorithm, is also available as a documentation."
